**Bubble Sort Visualization**


This project is a web-based application that allows users to visualize and evaluate sorting algorithm: Bubble Sort.
The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend.


**Technologies Used**

HTML: Provides the structure of the website.


CSS: Adds styling and layout for a visually appealing interface.


JavaScript: Implements the sorting algorithms and handles user interaction and real-time sorting visualization.

**Bubble Sort**


Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The process is repeated until no swaps are needed, indicating that the list is sorted.


**Characteristics:**

Time Complexity:

Best case: O(n) (when the list is already sorted)

Average case: O(n²)

Worst case: O(n²)

Space Complexity: O(1) (in-place sorting)

**Use Cases:**

While Bubble Sort is not efficient for large datasets compared to more advanced algorithms like Quick Sort or Merge Sort, it is useful for educational purposes and small datasets due to its simplicity.
